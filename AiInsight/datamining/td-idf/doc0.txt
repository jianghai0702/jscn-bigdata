The question of intelligence is the last great terrestrial frontier of science
Most big scientific questions involve the very small the very large or events 
that occurred billions of years ago But everyone has a brain You are your brain 
If you want to understand why you feel the way you do how you perceive the world
why you make mistakes how you are able to be creative why music and art are inspiring 
indeed what it is to be human then you need to understand the brain In addition a successful 
theory of intelligence and brain function will have large societal benefits and not 
just in helping us cure brain-related diseases We will be able to build genuinely 
intelligent machines although they won't be anything like the robots of popular
fiction and computer science fantasy Rather intelligent machines will arise 
from a new set of principles about the nature of intelligence As such 
they will help us accelerate our knowledge of the world help us explore 
the universe and make the world safer And along the way a large industry will be created
