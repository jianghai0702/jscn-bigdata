Fortunately we live at a time when the problem of understanding intelligence 
can be solved Our generation has access to a mountain of data about the brain
collected over hundreds of years and the rate at which we are gathering more data 
is accelerating The United States alone has thousands of neuroscientists Yet we have 
no productive theories about what intelligence is or how the brain works as a whole
Most neurobiologists do not think much about overall theories of the brain because they're 
engrossed in doing experiments to collect more data about the brain many subsystems
And although legions of computer programmers have tried to make computers intelligent
they have failed I believe they will continue to fail as long as they keep ignoring the 
differences between computers and brains
