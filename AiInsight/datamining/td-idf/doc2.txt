I often refer to this theory and my approach to studying intelligence as 
real intelligence" to distinguish it from "artificial intelligence
AI scientists tried to program computers to act like humans without first answering 
what intelligence is and what it means to understand They left out the most important
part of building intelligent machines the intelligence Real intelligence makes the
point that before we attempt to build intelligent machines we have to first understand 
how the brain thinks and there is nothing artificial about that Only then can we ask 
how we can build intelligent machines
